# node-hid-parse
This package parses a buffer containg a USB [HID](https://www.usb.org/hid) report descriptor.

I implemented just enough of the HID usage tables to successfuly parse the report generated by an APC UPS
(sadly, a long, long story.)

The basic logic *should* be sound.
Accordingly,
[pull requests](https://github.com/homespun/node-hid-parse/pulls) --
particulary those with more tables --
are welcome.
(Don't worry, it's very simple to add more entries!)

If you know how to interpret units (codes `0x65`, `0x66`, and `0x67`),
then pull requests are also welcome.
